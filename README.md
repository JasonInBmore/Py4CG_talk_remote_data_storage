# Py4CG - Talk on remote data storage

The following repo contains information and code chucks related to the talk "Improve your life by moving data off your computer" given on April 1st. There's one markdown file for each "method" of remote data storage. **Most of the files will not run** because they require credentials, but they include code that can hopefully serve as a guide. Information about the method is in each of the markdown files. I am currently or have previously used all of these methods with R in production environments so please email me if you have any questions.
