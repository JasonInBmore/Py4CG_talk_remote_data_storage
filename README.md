# Py4CG - Talk on remote data storage

The following repo contains information and code chucks related to the talk "Improve your life by moving data off your computer" given on April 1st. There's one markdown file for each "method" of remote data storage. The files can be knitted into html, but **most of the code will not execute**. The code wouldn't work anyway since so many chunks require credentials. The included code can hopefully still serve as a guide. Information about the method is in each of the markdown files. I am currently or have previously used all of these methods with R in production environments so please reach out if you have any questions.
